# PyBer Ride Sharing Data Challenge

## Purpose
To use Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to create a summary DataFrame by city type and a multiple-line graph of total fares by each city type using the city and ride data csv.

## Results

Before getting the results we want to merge the two datasets into one DataFrame

    pyber_data_df = pd.merge(ride_data_df, city_data_df, how="left", on=["city", "city"])


### Total Rides
- Rural: 125
- Suburban: 625
- Urban: 1625

### Total Drivers

### Total Fares

### Average Fare Per Ride and Driver

### Total Fare by City Type

### Differences in Ride-Sharing Data among Different City Types
